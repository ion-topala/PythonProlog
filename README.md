# Medicine App

This is a simple application for querying various facts about medications using Prolog.
The application provides a GUI built with Tkinter, where the user can input a medication name, age, weight, and select a query from a list of predefined options.
The selected query will then be run against the Prolog knowledge base, and the result will be displayed in a text box on the GUI.
